# Multi-Modal-AI-App

The Multi-Modal AI App is a versatile tool that offers three key functionalities:

1. **Audio Transcription**: Utilizes the Whisper ASR system to convert audio files (e.g., .wav, .mp3) into text.

2. **Image Captioning**: Generates descriptive captions for uploaded images using the GIT [(GenerativeImage2Text), base-sized model](https://huggingface.co/microsoft/git-base).

3. **Text Generation**: Employs OpenAI's GPT-3.5 Turbo to generate human-like text based on user-provided prompts.
